Last updated: [24/12/2025]
Bharat Gurung built the MyTCGCollection app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Bharat Gurung at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way, except as described below.
Third Party Services
The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Google Play Services: Used for core functionality. Privacy Policy

Firebase Authentication: Used to allow you to log in and secure your account. This service may collect email addresses, passwords (encrypted), or user identifiers. Privacy Policy
•
Firebase Firestore (Cloud Firestore): Used to store your TCG collection data in the cloud so it syncs across devices. Any data you enter into the app (e.g., card names, sets, values) is stored here. Privacy Policy
Local Storage (Room Database)
This app uses a local database (Android Room) to store data directly on your device for offline access and performance. This data stays on your device unless you actively sync it with our cloud features (Firebase).
Network Requests (Retrofit & OkHttp)
The app interacts with third-party APIs (via Retrofit) to fetch data (likely Currency exchange rates).

This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser version, pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other statistics.
Image Loading (Coil)
This app uses Coil to load images from the internet. When fetching images, your IP address is visible to the server hosting the image.
Security
I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Links to Other Sites
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
